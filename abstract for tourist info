intelligent travel assistants
As convenience is the king in today’s world, smart concierge services, powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are gaining momentum in various industries. Travel booking is only one of the areas being heavily automated by algorithms.
Intelligent programs, trained to perform a certain task on a user’s request are usually referred to as “bots” or “chatbots.” With the top four chat apps having over 4 millions of monthly active users just for April 2018, instant messaging platforms are widely adopted by some prominent brands as a great way to reach out to the clients and build better customer relations.
For example, Hyatt, a global hospitality leader, has been using social platforms to connect with its customers since 2009. Recently, the company expanded its customer support toolset with Facebook Messenger. Yet such 24/7 mobile support requires significant resources, both human and financial. This is where AI-powered virtual assistants come in handy.
Most often integrating with popular instant messaging apps, such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram or Skype, virtual travel assistants are trained to perform various tasks. From searching for the cheapest deals, booking flights and making hotel reservations, to planning whole trips and enhancing your overall travel experience through useful information and valuable suggestions about popular tourist destinations, places to eat or local attractions — these are the most popular ways to use AI bots.
